# OS Scheduling

This project application for exploring various operating system scheduling policies. It provides a simulation environment where you can visualize and analyze the behavior of different scheduling algorithms.

## Features

- Supports multiple scheduling algorithms, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Round Robin (RR).
- Simulates process execution and displays Gantt charts to visualize the scheduling process.
- Allows customization of parameters such as quantum size for Round Robin scheduling.
